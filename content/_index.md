My name is Bobby. I am a Computer Science PhD student researching probabilistic machine learning for science (in particular, climate and environmental science). I am excited about new advancements in ML that aim to combine “unreasonable effectiveness” of deep learning with desirable properties of probabilistic methods, like explainability and well-quantified uncertainty. I believe machine learning can and should be a force for good.

I hope to update soon with more details about my projects and interests. In the meantime, feel free to check out my [CV (.pdf)](./files/Huggins_CV.pdf).
